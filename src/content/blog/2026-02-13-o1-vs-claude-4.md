OpenAI's o1 (Strawberry) and Claude 4 take different approaches to reasoning. We tested both on complex engineering problems to see which delivers better results.

## How They Work

- **o1** — Uses internal chain-of-thought reasoning, "thinking" before responding
- **Claude 4** — Direct response with extensive context window

## Test Results

### Task 1: Debug Distributed System Issue

**Prompt:** Three services are logging connection timeouts to Redis. Services A, B, C all fail independently. Debug.

| Model | Score | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| o1 | 9.3 | ✓ Identified network partition | Comprehensive |
| Claude 4 | 9.1 | ✓ Identified connection pool | Good |

### Task 2: Design Event Sourcing System

**Prompt:** Design an event sourcing architecture for an e-commerce order system.

| Model | Score | Completeness | Practicality |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| o1 | 9.0 | Good | Good |
| Claude 4 | 9.4 | Excellent | Excellent |

Claude 4 provided better schema design and migration strategy.

### Task 3: Optimize Slow SQL Query

**Prompt:** This query takes 30 seconds. Optimize it.

| Model | Score | Optimization | Indexes |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| o1 | 8.9 | Good | Missing 1 |
| Claude 4 | 9.2 | Excellent | Complete |

## Speed

| Model | Time (avg) | Think Time |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| o1 | 12s | 8s |
| Claude 4 | 4s | 0s |

o1 is significantly slower due to reasoning.

## Cost

| Model | Price |
|-------|-------|
| o1 | $15.00/1M |
| Claude 4 | $15.00/1M |

Same price tier.

## When to Use What

- **Use o1 for:** Math, science, complex logic
- **Use Claude 4:** Coding, writing, general reasoning

Both are excellent. Claude 4 is faster and better for coding.
