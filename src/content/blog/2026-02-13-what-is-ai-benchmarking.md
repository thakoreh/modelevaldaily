## What Is AI Benchmarking?

AI benchmarking is the process of testing AI models on standardized tasks to compare their performance. But not all benchmarks are created equal.

## Why Most Benchmarks Suck

Most AI benchmarks use:
- **Synthetic tasks** — Toy problems that don't reflect real work
- **Single-turn tests** — Don't measure sustained performance
- **No cost analysis** — Ignore real-world economics

## How We're Different

We test on:
- **Real engineering tasks** — Bug fixes, API integrations, docs
- **Multi-turn scenarios** — How models perform over time
- **Full cost analysis** — Including latency and token costs

## Our Scoring Rubric

Each task scores 0-10 on:
- **Correctness** — Does it solve the problem?
- **Efficiency** — Is the solution minimal?
- **Clarity** — Is the explanation clear?

## Key Metrics We Track

### Performance
- Task completion rate
- Accuracy
- Quality scores

### Cost
- Tokens used
- API cost per task
- Cost efficiency

### Latency
- Time to first token
- Total response time
- Tokens per second

### Reliability
- Failure rate
- Inconsistency
- Error types

## Why This Matters

Benchmarks should help you:
1. Pick the right model
2. Understand tradeoffs
3. Optimize costs

That's what we deliver.
