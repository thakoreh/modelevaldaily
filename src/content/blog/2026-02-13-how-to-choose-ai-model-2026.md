With dozens of models available, choosing the right one feels overwhelming. Here's a practical framework to make the decision.

## Step 1: Define Your Primary Use Case

| Use Case | Recommended Model |
|----------|------------------|
| Code writing/debugging | Claude 4, GPT-5 |
| Long documents analysis | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4 |
| Fast prototyping | Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o Mini |
| Open source/self-hosting | DeepSeek R1, Qwen |
| Agentic workflows | GPT-5, Claude 4 |
| Budget-constrained | Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek |

## Step 2: Evaluate Your Priorities

Ask yourself:

1. **What's more important: speed or quality?**
   - Speed → Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o Mini
   - Quality → Claude 4, GPT-5

2. **Do you need large context?**
   - 100K+ tokens → Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4.5
   - Standard context → Most models work

3. **Is cost a constraint?**
   - Tight budget → DeepSeek R1, Gemini Flash
   - Quality over cost → Claude 4, GPT-5

## Step 3: Test With Your Actual Work

Our recommended approach:

1. Pick 3 models that fit your criteria
2. Run 10 real tasks from your workflow
3. Score each on: accuracy, speed, cost
4. Pick the winner

## 2026 Model Landscape

| Tier | Models | Price Range |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Premium | Claude 4, GPT-5 | $15+/1M tokens |
| Mid-tier | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4o | $3-5/1M tokens |
| Budget | Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek R1 | $0.50-1.50/1M tokens |
| Free | Llama 3.3, Qwen 2.5 | Self-hosted |

## Our Recommendation

For most teams: **Start with GPT-5 for agents, Claude 4 for code review, and Gemini Flash for high-volume tasks.**

This gives you coverage without overspending.
