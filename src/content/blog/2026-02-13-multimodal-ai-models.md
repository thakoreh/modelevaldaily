## What Is Multimodal AI?

Multimodal models can process multiple types of input:
- Text + images
- Text + audio
- Text + video

## Current Models

### GPT-4V (Vision)
- **Strength:** Best overall
- **Limitations:** No audio/video
- **Best for:** Image analysis, document OCR

### Claude Vision
- **Strength:** Best for code from images
- **Limitations:** Slower
- **Best for:** Screenshot analysis, UI debugging

### Gemini 2.0
- **Strength:** Native multimodal (text, image, audio, video)
- **Limitations:** Less proven
- **Best for:** Complex multimodal tasks

## Use Cases

### Document Processing
Extract text from images, PDFs, screenshots.

### Code Understanding
Analyze architecture diagrams, flowcharts.

### Image Analysis
Debug UI issues, analyze plots.

### Audio Transcription
Transcribe and analyze audio.

## Capabilities Comparison

| Task | GPT-4V | Claude | Gemini |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| OCR | Excellent | Good | Excellent |
| Screenshots | Good | Excellent | Good |
| Diagrams | Good | Good | Excellent |
| Video | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

## When to Use Multimodal

- Processing uploaded images
- Screenshot analysis
- Document digitization
- Visual debugging

## Cost

Multimodal is 2-3x more expensive than text-only. Use only when needed.
