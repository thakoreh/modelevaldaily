Benchmarks are useful, but they’re rarely aligned with how teams actually ship software. ModelEval Daily exists to close that gap.

## What’s different
- **Real tasks:** shipping fixes, design choices, and workflow tasks.
- **Transparent prompts:** you can rerun everything.
- **Daily signal:** short evals you can scan in under 60 seconds.

## Who it’s for
- Engineers choosing a model for production.
- Product teams evaluating tool quality.
- Founders who need fast, reliable AI workflows.

## What to expect
Daily scorecards, quick head‑to‑heads, and a public rubric anyone can reuse.
