	<p>
		AIModelBenchmarks.com publishes lightweight, repeatable scorecards across coding, reasoning, and
		workflow tasks. We focus on practical outcomes: can the model ship features, debug reliably, and
		deliver usable output under time pressure?
	</p>

	<h2>Our Principles</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Transparent prompts.</strong> Every eval includes the exact prompt and rubric. You can rerun any test yourself.</li>
		<li><strong>Real tasks, not toy problems.</strong> We test what engineering teams actually do: fix bugs, make architecture decisions, wire up APIs.</li>
		<li><strong>Reproducible.</strong> Same inputs, same scoring, clear deltas over time. No hidden grading or subjective rankings.</li>
		<li><strong>Operator-first.</strong> We track cost, latency, and reliability -- the metrics that matter when you're running AI in production.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Eval Categories</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Coding:</strong> Small feature builds, bug fixes, refactors, API patches. Scored on correctness, code quality, and diff cleanliness.</li>
		<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Build-vs-buy decisions, debugging diagnosis, system design tradeoffs. Scored on constraint coverage, decision clarity, and actionability.</li>
		<li><strong>Tool use:</strong> Multi-step tasks using CLI tools, official documentation, and third-party APIs. Scored on doc-faithfulness, verification steps, and security hygiene.</li>
		<li><strong>RAG / Research:</strong> (Coming soon) Retrieval quality, synthesis accuracy, and citation faithfulness.</li>
		<li><strong>Agents:</strong> (Coming soon) Multi-step task completion, tool failure recovery, and plan coherence.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Scoring Rubric</h2>
	<p>
		Each task is scored out of 10 on three dimensions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Correctness (4 pts):</strong> Does the output solve the problem? Are there bugs, hallucinations, or missing requirements?</li>
		<li><strong>Speed-to-usable output (3 pts):</strong> How quickly does the model produce something an engineer can actually use?</li>
		<li><strong>Clarity (3 pts):</strong> Is the output well-structured, documented, and easy to review?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The weighted total rolls into the daily scorecard. We weight coding at 40%, reasoning at 35%, and tool-use at 25%.
	</p>

	<h2>How We Run Evals</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Task selection:</strong> We pick a real-world task from our backlog (contributed by engineers, PMs, and our team).</li>
		<li><strong>Prompt design:</strong> We write a clear, constrained prompt with explicit success criteria.</li>
		<li><strong>Model execution:</strong> We run the same prompt against every model under test (currently Claude Opus 4.6, 5.3-Codex-Spark, Kimi K2.5, MiniMax M2.5, GLM-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro).</li>
		<li><strong>Blind scoring:</strong> Outputs are scored against the rubric without knowing which model produced them.</li>
		<li><strong>Publication:</strong> The full scorecard -- prompt, rubric, scores, and analysis -- is published daily.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Models We Track</h2>
	<p>
		We currently evaluate <strong>Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic)</strong>, <strong>5.3-Codex-Spark (OpenAI)</strong>, <strong>Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot)</strong>, <strong>MiniMax M2.5</strong>, <strong>GLM-5 (Zhipu)</strong>, and <strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google)</strong>. We plan to add Llama, Mistral, and DeepSeek models as they reach production readiness.
